This is a draft document. Many of these functions will work as in Perl
5, except we're trying to rationalize everything into roles.  For
now you can assume most of the important functions will automatically
be in the * namespace.  However, with IO operations in particular,
many of them are really methods on an IO handle, and if there is a
corresponding global function, it's merely an exported version of
the method.

=head1 Default IO handles

In Perl 6, there are the I<standard> handles, and the I<default> handles.  

The I<standard> ones are our old familiar friends (with new names).  Standard input 
changed from STDIN to C<$*IN>, standard output changed from STDOUT to C<$*OUT>, and 
standard error changed from STDERR to C<$*ERR>.  

However, the I<default> ones replace the single handle set by the Perl 5 select() call 
with with three new variables.  
At the start of the program, the default handles (C<$*DEFIN>, C<$*DEFOUT>, and 
C<$*DEFERR>) are aliased to the standard handles, but may be temporarily or permanently 
rebound to some other file handle.  

Many of the roles and functions below will operate on the default handles.  To set all 3 
at once, do C<($*DEFIN, $*DEFOUT, $*DEFERR) ::= ($*IN, $*OUT, $*ERR)>.  

=head1 Roles and Classes

The roles and classes that define most of the functionality for IO are defined in 
S32-setting-library/IO.pod.  The main functions used are listed in S29 with references to 
S32-setting-library/IO.pod.

Please post errors and feedback to perl6-language.  If you are making
a general laundry list, please separate messages by topic.
