The document is a draft.

If you read the HTML version, it is generated from the pod in the pugs 
repository under /docs/Perl6/Spec/S32-setting-library/Temporal.pod so edit it there in
the SVN repository if you would like to make changes.

=head2 Time

=over

=item gmtime

 our Time multi gmtime ( Time $time? )
 our Time multi method gmtime ( Time $time: )

Identical to:

 Time::localtime(:$time,:tz<GMT>)

=item localtime

 our Time multi localtime ( Time $time?, Time::Zone $tz? )
 our Time multi method localtime ( Time $time: Time::Zone $tz? )

Returns a time object whose default timezone is C<$tz> (or the system's
default timezone if none is provided).

If used as a function, and no time is provided, the current time is used.

Note that no matter what, C<$time>'s concept of "its timezone" is discarded
in favor of something new.

=item time

 our Time multi time()

Returns a C<Time> object. There are a number of uses for this
object, all of which can be found in the documentation for C<Time>.

There is, by default, no timezone associated with this Time object, so
whatever default the system has will take over if timezone-specific
data is accessed.
