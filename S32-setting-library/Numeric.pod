=head1 VERSION

    Created: 19 Mar 2009 extracted from S29-functions.pod

    Last Modified: 1 Sep 2009
    Version: 3

The document is a draft.

If you read the HTML version, it is generated from the Pod in the pugs
repository under /docs/Perl6/Spec/S32-setting-library/Numeric.pod so edit it there in
the SVN repository if you would like to make changes.

This documents Bit, Int, Num, Rat, Complex, and Bool.

XXX So where are Bit, Int, and Rat

=head1 Function Packages

=head2 Bool

=over 4

=item succ

 our Bool multi method succ ( Bool $b: ) is export

Returns C<Bool::True>.

=item pred

 our Bool multi method pred ( Bool $b: ) is export

Returns C<Bool::False>.

=back

=head2 Num

The following are all defined in the C<Num> role:

B<API document>: L<Num>

C<Num> provides some constants in addition to the basic
mathematical functions.

    constant pi is export = 3.14159_26535_89793_23846_26433_83279_50288;
    constant e  is export = 2.71828_18284_59045_23536_02874_71352_66249;

=over

=item succ

 our Num multi method succ ( Num $x: ) is export
 our Int multi method succ ( Int $x: ) is export

Returns the successor of C<$x>. This method is used by C<< prefix:<++> >> and
C<< postfix:<++> >> to increment the value in a container.

=item pred

 our Num multi method pred ( Num $x: ) is export
 our Int multi method pred ( Int $x: ) is export

Returns the predeccessor of C<$x>. This method is used by C<< prefix:<--> >>
and C<< postfix:<--> >> to decrement the value in a container.

=item abs

 our Num multi method abs ( Num $x: ) is export

Absolute Value.

=item floor

 our Int multi method floor ( Num $x: ) is export

Returns the highest integer not greater than C<$x>.

=item ceiling

 our Int multi method ceiling ( Num $x: ) is export

Returns the lowest integer not less than C<$x>.

=item round

 our Int multi method round ( Num $x: ) is export

Returns the nearest integer to C<$x>.  The algorithm is C<floor($x + 0.5)>.
(Other rounding algorithms will be given extended names beginning with "round".)

=item truncate

 our Int multi method truncate ( Num $x: ) is export

Returns the closest integer to C<$x> whose absolute value is not greater
than the absolute value of C<$x>.  (In other words, just chuck any
fractional part.)  This is the default rounding function used by
implicit integer conversions.

You may also truncate using explicit integer casts, either C<Int()> for
an arbitrarily large integers, or C<int()> for native integers.

=item exp

 our Num multi method exp ( Num $exponent: Num :$base = Num::e ) is export

Performs similar to C<$base ** $exponent>. C<$base> defaults to the
constant I<e>.

=item log

 our Num multi method log ( Num $x: Num $base = Num::e ) is export

Logarithm of base C<$base>, default Natural. Calling with C<$x == 0> is an
error.

=item log10

 our Num multi method log10 (Num $x:) is export

A base C<10> logarithm, othewise identical to C<log>.

=item rand

 our Num term:<rand>

Pseudo random number in range C<< 0 ..^ 1 >>.  That is, C<0> is
theoretically possible, while C<1> is not.  Note that there is no
unary C<rand> function in Perl 6, so just multiply C<rand> by your
desired multiplier.  For picking a random integer you probably want
to use something like C<(1..6).pick> instead.

=item sign

 our Int multi method sign ( Num $x: ) is export

Returns 1 when C<$x> is greater than 0, -1 when it is less than 0, 0 when it
is equal to 0, or undefined when the value passed is undefined.

=item srand

 multi method srand ( Num $seed: )
 multi srand ( Num $seed = default_seed_algorithm())

Seed the generator C<rand> uses. C<$seed> defaults to some combination
of various platform dependent characteristics to yield a non-deterministic seed.
Note that you get one C<srand()> for free when you start a Perl program, so
you I<must> call C<srand()> yourself if you wish to specify a deterministic seed
(or if you wish to be differently nondeterministic).

=item sqrt

 our Num multi method sqrt ( Num $x: ) is export

Returns the square root of the parameter.

=item roots

  (in Num) method roots (Num $x: Int $n --> List of Num) is export

Returns a list of all C<$n>th (complex) roots of C<$x>

=item cis

    our Complex multi method cis (Num $angle:) is export

Returns 1.unpolar($angle)

=item unpolar

    our Complex multi method unpolar (Num $mag: Num $angle) is export

Returns a complex number specified in polar coordinates.  Angle is in radians.

=item i

 our Num multi postfix:<i> ( Num $x )

Returns a complex number representing the parameter multiplied by the imaginary
unit C<i>.  Note that there is no C<.i> method.  To follow a variable name
with the postfix, it's necessary to use a backslash or parentheses:

    $land\i
    ($land)i

=back


=head2 Complex

=over 4

=item polar

    our Seq multi method polar (Complex $nim:) is export

Returns (magnitude, angle) corresponding to the complex number.
The magnitude is non-negative, and the angle in the range C<-π ..^ π>.

=item re

    method re() {...}

Returns the real part of the complex number.

=item im

    method im() {...}

Returns the imaginary part of a complex number.

=back

=head2 Trigonometric functions

The following are also defined in C<Num>.  The trig functions
depend on the current (lexically scoped) trig base:

 enum TrigBase is export <Radians Degrees Gradians Circles>;
 constant $?TRIGBASE = Radians;

=over 4

=item I<Standard Trig Functions>

 Num multi method func ( Num  $x: TrigBase $base = $?TRIGBASE ) is export

where I<func> is one of:
sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, sec, cosec, cotan, asec, acosec,
acotan, sinh, cosh, tanh, asinh, acosh, atanh, sech, cosech, cotanh,
asech, acosech, acotanh.

Performs the various trigonometric functions.

Option C<$base> is used to declare how you measure your angles.
Given the value of an arc representing a single full revolution.

 $base       Subdivisions of circle
 ----        ----------------------
 Radians     2*pi
 Degrees     360
 Gradians    400
 Circles     1

To change the base within your own lexical scope, it suffices to redefine the
compiler constant:

 constant $?TRIGBASE = Degrees;

=item atan2

 our Num multi method atan2 ( Num $y: Num $x = 1 )
 our Num multi atan2 ( Num $y, Num $x = 1 )

This second form of C<atan> computes the arctangent of C<$y/$x>, and takes
the quadrant into account. Otherwise behaves as other trigonometric functions.
