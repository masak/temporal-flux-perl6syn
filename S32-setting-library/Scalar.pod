The document is a draft.

If you read the HTML version, it is generated from the pod in the pugs 
repository under /docs/Perl6/Spec/S32-setting-library/Miscellaneous-scalars.pod 
so edit it there in the SVN repository if you would like to make changes.

=head1 Scalar

B<API document>: L<Scalar>

C<Scalar> provides the basic tools for operating on undifferentiated
scalar variables. All of the following are exported by default.

=over

=item undef

  constant Scalar Scalar::undef

Returns the undefined scalar object. C<undef> has no value at
all, but for historical compatibility, it will numify to C<0>
and stringify to the empty string, potentially generating a
warning in doing so. There are two ways to determine if a
value equal to undef: the C<defined> function (or method) can
be called or the C<//> (or C<orelse>) operator can be used.

C<undef> is also considered to be false in a boolean context.
Such a conversion does not generate a warning.

Perl 5's unary C<undef> function is renamed C<undefine> to avoid
confusion with the value C<undef> (which is always 0-ary now).

=item VAR

This is not really a method, but some kind of macro.  See L<S12> for details.
